# Project Description

This project was part of the "PHYS30762 Object-Oriented Programming in C++" course offered by the Physics Department of The University of Manchester. Its aim was to build a quantum circuit simulator in C++ similar to IBM's Qiskit library. The project required basic understanding of quantum computing and of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The most fundamental goal in terms of functionality was to build a circuit that uses the Hadamard and CNOT gates to return an entangled Bell state. Once this was achieved, the problem of adding more quantum gates (both single-qubit and multi-qubit) became trivial. As the number of qubits increases, the computational requirements of simulating quantum circuits on classical computers grow exponentially. Since pen and paper calculations can only be done for circuits with a couple of qubits, the preferred way of checking the results was to run them against IMB's simulator.

Build your own quantum circuit in /Examples/main.cpp and check your results against IBM's qiskit quantum simulator. More details can be found in the project report.
